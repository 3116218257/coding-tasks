Please follow the steps below to serve the model [Qwen2.5-Coder-0.5B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-0.5B-Instruct) using vLLM on the CPU and evaluate its performance on the [HumanEval-X](https://huggingface.co/datasets/THUDM/humaneval-x) task:

1. **Serving the Model with vLLM**:  
   - Utilize the [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) to serve the model on the CPU.
   - Create a Python script to set up a Docker instance that serves the model. This will ensure the environment is consistent and portable.  

2. **Inference Script**:  
   - Develop a script to perform inference on both Python and Java samples from the HumanEval-X dataset.  
   - This script should interact with the served model to generate predictions for the provided samples.  

3. **Evaluation**:  
   - Use a sandbox environment(docker instance) to assess the pass rate of the HumanEval-X results obtained from the Qwen2.5-Coder-0.5B-Instruct model.  
   - This evaluation will help determine the effectiveness of the model's predictions.
